# Machine Learning with Python

## üìÑ Summary 
This course provides an overview of the purpose of machine learning and its real-world applications. It then covers topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and various useful machine learning algorithms.

Many sample projects are launched and explored to explore machine learning methods and related algorithms, including cancer detection, economic trend forecasting, customer churn forecasting, and recommendation engines.

The final project in this course is to build a classifier that predicts whether a loan offer will be repaid. This is a classification problem, and KNNs, decision trees, SVMs, and logistic regression are all used to determine the best algorithm to use.
