# Data Visualization with Python

## üìÑ Summary 
In this course, you will learn how to present and visualize complex data in ways that are meaningful to humans and how to find and derive insights easily. This course explores Canadian immigration data using several Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium. Also explains how to use Plotly Dash to create a dashboard which will combine the skills that are learned to analyze and report on the performance of the domestic US flights into one dashboard.
