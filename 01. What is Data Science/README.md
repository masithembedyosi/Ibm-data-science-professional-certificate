### My Definition of Data Science
Data science is a new field of study that draws on business, statistics, and computer science. It's about deriving insights from raw data and turning them into actionable predictive information. Technologies such as Tableau, R, SAS, SQL,Hadoop, Apache Spark and python are tools that provide insight into collected data. In addition to traditional statistical tasks such as building predictive models and analyzing market trends, data scientists can also perform machine learning and knowledge discovery techniques such as cluster analysis and regression analysis.
